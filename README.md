### Hi there 👋

I'm Qunzhang, a passionate developer with a keen interest in control systems and path planning. My journey has been filled with adventures in C++, Python, and MATLAB, and here's a brief about my expertise and interests.  

🛠️ My Toolbox
Languages: C++, Python, MATLAB  
Control Systems: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Model Predictive Control (MPC)
Path Planning & Control: [A*, RRT*]  
Filter:[EKF, CKF, UKF]  
Machine Learning: [TensorFlow, PyTorch]  
🚀 Projects
Control Systems Simulation: [(https://github.com/Qunzhang1996/SSY281MPC.git)] - A MATLAB based project where I implemented an MPC&LQR.  

Path Planning and Control for Drone and Vehicle: [(https://github.com/Qunzhang1996/Driveless_PNC.git)] - Utilized CPP to design an efficient path planning algorithm and Controller for Drone and Vehicle. For the Drone, most related to PID controller. For the vehicle, related to Horizontal control, vertical control, PID, LQR and MPC.  

Machine Learning Model: [Link to a specific project/repo]   

🌱 Learning & Future Goals
Deep Dive into MPC: I aim to explore more complexities and applications of Model Predictive Control.  

Machine Learning in Control Systems: Keen on harnessing the power of ML to improve traditional control strategies.
